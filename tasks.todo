Post Jam Tasks:
  Movement refactor:
    ✔ add acceleration to forward speed @done(24-08-09 09:02)
    ☐ whale is always moving forwards with a minimum speed
      ☐ movement intent adds to this speed
      ☐ however the "y" value is always positive (i.e. whale can't move backwards)
      ☐ add an exception to this for "go slow" or "stop" zones near specific POI
      ☐ whale position on screen independent of speed
    ☐ wave movement based on current whale speed
      ☐ waves move slightly faster as the whale moves faster
      ☐ value changes near the boundaries of the screen
    ☐ add whale turning animation

    Following Movement:
      ☐ following whales point sideways when "stopped" instead of forwards with the main whale

  Weather:
    ☐ wind
    ☐ storms

  More Encounters:
    ☐ add more encounters
    ☐ sharks
    ☐ other whale types
    ☐ other whale interactions

  Exploration encounters:
    ☐ islands
    ☐ shipwrecks

  Ambience:
    ☐ add more music variety
    ☐ longer music tracks
    ☐ blend between tracks

  QOL fixes:
    Jam template changes, worth rebasing?:
      Not going to do these, no sense in a "rewrite". 
      Nothing is fundamentally broken in this version.
      ✘ ui @cancelled(24-08-09 09:00)
      ✘ soundfx @cancelled(24-08-09 09:00)
      ✘ anything else? @cancelled(24-08-09 09:00)
    ☐ ships avoid icebergs :grimace:
    ☐ icebergs have different sizes and shapes (without blurring)

  Bugs:
    ☐ it doesn't snow after the first northern migration

Absolute nice to haves:
  ☐ spatial audio for ships

Jam Tasks:
  ✔ remove template art work and sound effects
  ✔ spawn the whale
  ✔ show the controls (minimal tutorial)
  ✔ spawn starting waves
  ✔ periodically spawn other waves
  ✔ waves move
  ✔ background music
  ✔ encounter spawning system
  whale movement:
    ✔ turn the whale when arrow keys are pressed
    ✔ move the waves diagonally when arrow keys pressed
  add encounters:
    birds:
      ✔ bird graphics added to `creature.png`
      ✔ bird spawner
      ✔ birds randomly spawn every X seconds
      ✔ if birds get close, they circle the whale
      ✔ after a while, the birds leave
      ✔ add a "wander in area" behaviour while following the whale
      ✔ bird sound effects
    schools of fish:
      ✔ create fish sprite
      ✔ spawn fish
      ✔ fish boids
      ✔ fish encounters
      ✔ fish avoid the whale
    ships:
      ✔ ship sprites
      ✔ ship wake
      ✔ engine noise
      ✔ ship occludes waves, fish, whale but not birds
    other whales:
      ✔ whalesong
  Weather cycles:
    ✔ day/night
    ✔ rain
    ✔ snow
    ✔ icebergs
  polish:
    ✔ restyle the menu
    ✔ make rotate + wave movement lerp smoothly transition between left/off/right instead of jumping immediately
    ✔ when the whale turns there is a lot of empty space at the screen edges - no waves
    ✔ move whale not things around the whale
    ✔ update the credits
    ✔ refactor whale movement to make it a bit less janky when turning
    ✔ refactor whale following movement
    ✔ fix baby not displaying
    ✔ fix baby whale movement
    ✔ fix flipped movement
    ✔ refactor spawning rates to correspond with distance a bit better
    ✔ snow first when travelling north
    ✔ fix flip text
    ✔ ship horn only sounds once
  code "quality" lol:
    ✔ store whale position in a resource
  stretch goals:
    ✔ periodically come up to breathe
    ✔ don't allow whale rotation until the whale has fully completed its entrance animation and is positioned on the screen
    ✔ Display player help icons after movement complete.
    ✔ add the movement easter egg (its a secret)
    add the cycles easter egg (its also a secret):
      ✔ flip camera
      ✔ flip anything that needs flipping
      ✔ flip the controls
      ✔ flip on a timer
      ✔ flip text
      add phase 1 on the northern flip:
        ✔ make it 100% likely on flip 1
        ✔ make it not 100% on future flips
      ✔ add phase 2 on the southern flip (if the northern one occurs)
  bugs:
    ✔ starting wave animations all start at the same frame so they're all in sync
    ✔ crash in movement when window minimised or in the background due to `windows.single()`
    ✔ move targets aren't updated on screen resize, meaning that things just pile up on the screen edges
  jam admin:
    ✔ update `Cargo.toml`
    ✔ fix CI yaml file
    ✔ set up itch page
    ✔ do a test release
    ✔ work out why the itch build isn't working
    ✔ do a "Final final v1 latest" release before the jam ends
    ✔ deploy to itch
    ✔ add screenshots and details to the jam page
    ✔ test deployed version
